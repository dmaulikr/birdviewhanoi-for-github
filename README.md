It is a iPhone game. The tower of hanoi. Because other tower of hanoi games have only 7 levels or less, I designed 
the bird view play mode that can play 12 levels.
The rule of the game is simple:
1. Move all the leaves from A to B. You can use C to help.
2. Only move one leaf each time.
3. The leaf with small number must always be over the one with big number.

To finish all 12 levels, the minimum steps you need is 4097.
